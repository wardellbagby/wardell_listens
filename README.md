It's true. I'm Wardell, and listen is what I do.

## What is this?

This is a repository containing the code that runs
the [@wardell_listens](https://twitter.com/wardell_listens) Twitter account.

## How does it work?

It uses my [ListenBrainz listens](https://listenbrainz.org/user/wardellbagby/)
to tweet out a new track every week, based on what I listened to the past week. It uses a GitHub
action, scheduled to run every Monday at 9:30am PDT, to comb through the weekly listens and
find a new track to tweet out.

## Why does it exist?

Music is meant to be shared, and good music doubly so. Plus, now everyone can see exactly how bad my
taste in music is!
